3B1b) Download and install nodejs


First download nodejs here : https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

I recommend to use the more reliable LTS version, which is node version 10

Choose the LTS version (stable), then double click on the installer and say yes to all messages during the installation



Then create a shortcut of the node.js command line, to desktop

This will make our use much easier later : go in this folder :

C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu

(it was hidden earlier, you need to have done the preparations first to see it)
And create a shortcut to desktop



Every time you want to launch this node.js shortcut, launch it as admin as shown below



Note : Another way of doing it is to press start menu, then write “node”, then click on “node.js command prompt” (as admin), but i prefer to have a shortcut in desktop
