gtp2ogs is a javascript program used to communicate in both directions (in and out) in GTP language between your AI bot engine (example : PhoenixGo, leela zero, etc..) and the OGS distant board where the game is played
npm (node package manager) is a package manager that we will use to install gtp2ogs


In this tutorial we use the example of ubuntu because it’s a famous and easy to use linux distribution, but it should work with any linux distribution, especially the most common ones (some steps may slightly differ though)
