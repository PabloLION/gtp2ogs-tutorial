3B3) Optional : Upgrade gtp2ogs from old branch to devel (latest) branch

(You can skip this step if you dont want it)

Npm (node package manager) installs an old branch of gtp2ogs
I recommend to use rather the devel branch (latest with improvements and fixes)
To do that, download from the gtp2ogs github the “devel” branch in a zip archive :
https://github.com/online-go/gtp2ogs/tree/devel 




Then extract the zip archive, copy all files in the archive from downloaded path, to path where gtp2ogs was installed in node_modules, and overwrite old files (you can make a backup of gtp2ogs.js first and rename it gtp2ogs.js-backup if you want)
