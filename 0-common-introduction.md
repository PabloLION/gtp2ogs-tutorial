Prerequisites:
An AI that is compatible with GTP protocol (=Go Text Protocol, so that the bot plays automatically without needing to relay moves manually. If you want to manually relay moves, dont follow this tutorial)
In main ogs https://online-go.com/ : 1 ogs user account, 1 other ogs user account that will become ogs bot account
In beta ogs https://beta.online-go.com/ : 1 beta.ogs user account, 1 other beta.ogs user account that will become beta.ogs bot account
System : windows, linux, mac
Compute device compatible with your ai : mostly GPU with drivers compatible with your AI (for example for PhoenixGo Nvidia 384, CUDA 9.0 and Cudnn 7.1.4 are known good), it is possible to compute moves with CPU only (no GPU), but it will be much much slower


For example : 
Beta ogs account 1 (will be a beta bot) : https://beta.online-go.com/player/787 
Beta ogs account 2 (will be a beta user bot admin) : https://beta.online-go.com/player/786 
Official ogs account 1 (will be an official bot) : https://online-go.com/user/view/479173 
Official ogs account 2 (will be the official user bot admin, you can use your personal account for that) : https://online-go.com/player/592558/ 


Now that these prerequirements are fullfilled, we can start the steps :

Note : bot and ai mean the same thing, both words are used in this tutorial
