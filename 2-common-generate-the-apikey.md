Wait until a moderator answers you
When they do it for you, your beta ogs bot account will have a grey name and if you go to the bot profile page, you will see that the the beta bot admin is now your beta user account
Now that your bot has a grey name, connect to your beta user account, and go to the profile page of your beta bot account

For example, i connect to this betaogs user account https://beta.online-go.com/player/786/ 
Then go to the profile page of my betaogs bot here : https://beta.online-go.com/player/787 








Then scroll down a little the profile, and you will see the API Key window on the right side in “Bot Controls” (same as screenshot above) : 

If no API Key number appears (53e4288… in my example), click “generate API key
Then give your bot any name in bot engine (for example for me “PhoenixGo 20b”), the name will appear in “Engine” description of the profile
and click “Save”

An API key is like a password, we will use it to connect directly to your bot on OGS later, please dont share it !

You should see an “Engine” line : with the name you chose (for example “PhoenixGo 20b”)
The steps for official ogs are the exact same, but with official ogs accounts
