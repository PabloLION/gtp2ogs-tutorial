To make your beta ogs account 1 into a beta bot account (grey name), you need to private message all OGS moderators and ask them to do it

OGS moderators will require you first to make some stability tests on the beta.ogs server, and when it works on beta.ogs, ask them again to make your bot account a grey name in official ogs

It may also be helpful to send the same request publicly on OGS english chat

This is an example of message you can send [in english chat](https://online-go.com/chat)
